### Cleaning a New Season ###

# On MSI, compare number of files between the hard drive and MSI to make sure that all files have transferred over 
cd /shared/scripts/
./count_files.py ../SX/ > files_in_SX.txt

# Extract date-times
./extract_date.py SeasonX /home/packerc/shared/SX/

# Check date-times error list
# - fix what can
# - move videos to a seperate folder
# - move corrupt files to a separate folder

# Re-run extract date-times 

# Extract captures 
./set_up_captures.py 8 Season8_date_times.csv S8_captures.csv
<script> <season as number> <output from date-times> <new output file>

# Manually clean up captures as necessary 

# Now, switch to R

#### NOTE: IN NEXT SEASON, FOR CAPTURE EVENTS WITH EXTRA IMAGES THAT ARE INVALID, CALL INVALID IMAGES INVALID 0 AND THE REST VALID; THEN, RENUMBER ALL INVALID0 IMAGES SO HAVE UNIQUE NUMBER 

# All scripts (+ Ali's protocol) on MSI in "TimeStamps" directory 

# Save all SX_captures.csv to the Data/Capture directory (or manually change directory structure) 

# Run ErrorChecking.R 

# Save the roll summary as SXActions.csv in the ActionLists directory

# Aad column headings in the same format as previous action lists (Action, First/Last/All, Imfrom, Imto, Cap From, Cap To, DateFrom, DateTo, Diff, Comment)

# Use interactive code in CheckIndivRoll.R to assess issues with each roll and identify actions: 
	INVALID (get rid of forever)
	INVALID2 (maybe with extensive checking of field notes, could be salvageable)
	INVALID3 (checked the field notes, the hours can't be corrected and thus can't be used for temporal data, but could maybe be used for non-temporal data)
	TIMECHANGE (will correct time)
	OK
	FLAG (keep an eye on for some reason)
	ADDRESSED (error taken care of somewhere else in the Action List)
# Roll subsets are: ALL, FIRST, LAST, and PARTIAL; this cannot be blank
# Note that no fixes are run on rolls marked as OK, FLAG, ADDRESSED 

# Save Action List and run Cleaning.R

# Run ErrorIterate.R
# This also checks for bad captures; check to see if the errors need addressing; add anything to the SXActionList

# Rerun ErrorIterate.R as necessary until no errors (that need fixing) remain

# Go to Access database, extract all of records where field assistants entered that they changed times (TimeFrom, TimeTo); calculate dif in times (only need to deal with ones that are more than 20-30 mins off); figure out which rolls belong to by matching up dates; won't be clear *when* times went bad -- used CheckIndivRoll.R to see if you can see any weird lags or leaps; go through actual photos to see if you can pinpoint any switches
# Once you've figured out what needs to happen with these, add to the Action List, then rerun Cleaning.R and ErrorIterate.R

# Look for captures with multiple images and figure out why 
# Look for night captures with no flash

# Clean up final output by running FinalClean.R (also for any manual fixes -- save notes of manual fixes on MSI & GitHub)
