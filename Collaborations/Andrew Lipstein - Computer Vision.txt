Andrew Lipstein from Thomson-Reuters got in touch with Margaret in April about using Snapshot images as part of a company-wide contest in which employees will try to identify cheetahs in pictures. Nathalie Pettorelli is the biologist they're collaborating with and Sandra Crewe runs the corporate partnership. The partnership is formally TR and Zoological Society of London. 

I sent him a selection of day and night images with cheetahs, other spotted cats, and other animals in them. I sent links to the image URLS already online. In May they were downloading and processing our images. Collaborators are Maria Del Carmen Santa Cruz Roldan, Peter Keyngnaert and Jan Waerniers, all at TR.

Last communication was May 23 when they were getting ready to launch the challenge.
