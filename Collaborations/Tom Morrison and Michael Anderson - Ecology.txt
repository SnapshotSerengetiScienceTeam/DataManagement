Margaret and I spoke with Tom Morrison about doing a "Snapshot Serengeti: Western Corridor Edition" or something 
(I realize their cameras are all over...). We would run this as a special mini-season after our S8 finishes, processing their
images through the main SS interface. MCK's notes on the Jan 21 2015 meeting are below.

--------
Overview
--------
2+ years; 10 cameras spread out; 150 GB images; 185,000 
images
Images taken every half-hour AND by movement.
Single images.
Day and night. But half-hour schedule only during the 
day. Movement at night.
1.5 m off the ground, attached to trees.

--------------------
Things to figure out
--------------------
Are images a different dimension/size?

Is the EXIF metadata the same for Bushnell? Can we use 
our date/time extraction script?

Image relabeling should happen. Files are named the same 
and sorted by site and time in directories labeled by 
download date (analagous to "roll").

Sites can be nicknamed with three-letter code.

Need to decide where images will end up. Will we take 
them to MSI? Just leave them on Google Drive? Officially 
archive them with an archiving service? 

----------------------
Other things discussed
----------------------
Need to write blog posts and be on Talk.

By September for classifications is okay.

Additional animals?
maybe oribi -- put in blog post and hashtag
