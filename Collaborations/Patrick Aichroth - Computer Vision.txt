Patrick contacted Grant Miller at Zooniverse in March 2014, who then contacted Ali. Grant wrote "we've recently started collaborating with a group of computer scientists who are keen on developing technologies for analysing various media." Patrick is at Fraunhofer Institut fuer Digitale Medientechnologie (IDMT) in Germany.

Ali and I exchanged a couple emails with Patrick in March and April. Colleagues are Alex Loos and Christian Weigel, also at Fraunhofer. Uwe Kuehhirt has been CCed on these emails as well. Alex wrote that they had previously worked on detection of Great Apes in real-world settings. They have had students, as well.

Last contact April 3, though it looks like we dropped the ball on continuing the conversation with them.
