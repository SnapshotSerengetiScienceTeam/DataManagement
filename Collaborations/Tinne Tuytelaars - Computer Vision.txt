Tinne Tuytelaars contacted Margaret in October of 2013 with an interest in automated classification. She is a professor at KU Leuven, Belgium. Her lab has done bird species classification.

She has an account at MSI to download images.

Things went slowly, then in July she asked again for access. By the time she had gotten access to MSI images, the student she had in mind for the project found something else. In July, she had two new students who were interested.

The new "student" is Efstratios "Kostas" Gavves, who calls himself a "PostDoc student", whatever that means. He contacted me in October, keen to get access to the images. In November he asked lots of detailed questions. Last contact Nov 21.
