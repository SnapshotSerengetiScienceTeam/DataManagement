Cusack, J., Swanson, A., Coulson, C., Packer, C., Carbone, C., Dickman, A., Kosmala, M., Lintott, C., Rowcliffe, M. In Review. Applying a random encounter model to estimate lion density from camera traps in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania

Currently in review, this paper uses the camera trap photo rates to estimate lion densities. The aim is to test this in Serengeti, where we know the actual lion numbers, and eventually apply this as a conservation method elsewhere.
